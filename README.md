## Testing
 
### Validation
 
I ran my code through the W3C validator and a number of them were free of errors such as "gallery.html", "index.html" and "store.html". style.css was also run through a css validator with no issue. The following html files however had errors.
 
#### blog.html
 
![blog.html validation](/assets/readMeImages/Blog.png)
 
These are all fixed.
 
#### privacy.html
 
![privacy.html validation](/assets/readMeImages/privacy.png)
 
These are all fixed.
 
#### signup.html
 
![signup.html validation](/assets/readMeImages/sign-up.png)
 
These are all fixed
 
#### contact.html
 
![contact.html validation](/assets/readMeImages/contact.png)
 
These issues are to do with the embedded google map window. I don't know how to remove these issues as it was code given to me by google. I have left them as they are.
